By day, Iâ€™m a Computer Scientist, but by night, I transform into a full-fledged bibliophile! For me, reading is more than just a hobbyâ€”itâ€™s one of my favorite ways to unwind, escape the hustle of daily life, and dive into endless worlds of adventure and imagination.

This year, I decided to launch Bookish and Bold as a side project to document my reading journey in 2025. One of my biggest (but pressure-free!) goals is to read 100 books.

Iâ€™ve also had friends and family frequently ask me for book recommendations, so I figured, why not make this a space where I can share my favorite reads?

On this site, youâ€™ll find:

- A **fun, interactive dashboard** tracking my progress. Iâ€™m excited to see it grow and evolve as the year goes on!
- In-depth **book reviews** under the "Book Reviews" tab, where Iâ€™ll share thoughts on the stories that captivate me.

But thatâ€™s not all. Beyond reading 100 books this year, I have another dream: curating a collection of 1,000 books and building my own little library someday. No rushâ€”itâ€™s all part of the journey.

So, feel free to explore, get inspired, and maybe even join me on this bookish adventure. Hereâ€™s to a year full of pages and possibilities!
